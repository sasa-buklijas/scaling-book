# Introduction to fee bumping

The fee market in Bitcoin can be very dynamic, with the fee-rate required for a
transaction to be included in a block increasing or decreasing rapidly.

![](./img/mempool.png)
*(Six months of mempool size, grouped by fee-rate, from https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#1,24h)*

One of the reasons for the volatility in the fee-rate is that the mechanism
used to select what to include in a block is a market. In this market, the
miners supply 4Mweight of block space every ~10 minutes and users bid (through
transaction fees) to have their transaction included in a block. Different
wallets’ fee estimation algorithms are often naive and users are sometimes
insensitive to high fee-rates, which means that when the mempool grows to more
than a few megabytes and expected confirmation times start rising, a rapidly
escalating bidding war can ensue, with wallets attaching extremely high fees to
transactions.

This market has one strange quirk: if a user’s bid is unsuccessful and the
transaction isn’t included in a block, _the bid is not withdrawn_, and is still
valid for the next block. This is because transactions have an invariant
property that once they’re valid for inclusion in a block, then they will be
valid for inclusion in any subsequent block. In fact, the only way to
invalidate an already valid transaction (and thereby ‘withdraw’ that
transaction’s bid for block inclusion) is to spend its inputs in a conflicting
transaction.

This quirk generally isn’t a problem for users, since if a user signs a
transaction and they’re happy for it to be confirmed now, then presumably
they’d be happy for it to be confirmed at some point in the future for that
same fee-rate. However, there is one scenario in which the inability to
withdraw a transaction from the mempool can become a serious problem for users:
when the user has not attached a high enough fee-rate for the transaction to be
confirmed in a block, and the user has an urgent need for the transaction to be
confirmed. This could happen for many reasons: the wallet or user has
underestimated how much fee is required, the user has tried to save fees by
bidding at the low end of the fee estimation range, or the required fee rate
has just spiked unexpectedly after the transaction was broadcast. Whatever the
reason, the user finds themself with a transaction that is ‘stranded’ in the
mempool with a low fee rate, and a very low chance of being confirmed in future
blocks.

The risk of having a transaction getting stuck impedes on users’ leeway to
make low bids on transaction fees. If there is no way to get a transaction
unstuck after it’s been broadcast, then users are forced to bid conservatively
(high) to avoid the risk of having their transaction get stuck.

We therefore need a method to bump up the fee on an already broadcast
transaction for a couple of reasons:

1. To allow users to ‘unstick’ an already broadcast transction.
1. To give users the leeway to bid low on transaction fee-rate, with the
   option to later bump the fee up.

### The solutions

There are two common solutions for unsticking a payment that is stranded in the
mempool: Replace-by-fee (RBF) and Child Pays for Parent (CPFP):

##### Replace By Fee (RBF)

The user constructs and signs a replacement transaction which spends one or
more of the same inputs as the stuck transaction but pays additional fee
(usually by reducing the amount of bitcoin for the change output and leaving
the extra value as additional fee). If the replacement transaction attaches
enough fee, then miners will be incentivized to include it in a block.

##### Child Pays For Parent (CPFP) 

The user creates a new transaction which spends one or more of the outputs of
the stuck transaction. This child transaction attaches a large fee - enough to
increase the combined fee-rate for itself and the stuck transaction above the
required fee-rate for inclusion in a block. Note that this is only possible
when the user owns some of the outputs

When selecting transactions for inclusion in a block, miners will consider
‘packages’ of transactions, and will look at the total fee-rate across the
entire package of ancestors and descendants. The miner is incentivized to do
this to maximize the total fee yield from the block.

This feature could rightly be called Descendants-Pay-For-Ancestors since the
a rational miner will try to maximize their fee by considering packages of
transactions greater than 2 deep. For example, the Bitcoin Core mining code
considers packages of up to 25 transactions in any length of chain. 

## User experience considerations

Fee bumping strategy has a very visible impact on user experience of a Bitcoin
wallet or service. Bitcoin services need to consider issues such as:

- Having no fee bumping strategy at all can lead to very poor user experience in
  cases where mempool fee-rates spike and a transaction becomes stuck
  indefinitely.
- Some services offer Service Level Agreements that guarantee confirmations
  within a certain number of blocks or within a certain time period. Failing to
  meet those SLAs leads to customer complaints and tickets.  (Whether such SLAs
  are realistic or desirable is outside the scope of this document!)
- Some Bitcoin wallets and services treat transactions that signal
  opt-in RBF differently from those that don’t (for example not showing RBF
  transactions in a user’s balance). This can be confusing for users sending from
  wallets that signal opt-in RBF. 
- Fee bumping with RBF creates a new transaction with a new txid. This can be
  confusing for users if they don’t understand that a payment’s txid/vout index
  will change when the transaction is RBF’ed.
- Fee bumping with RBF invalidates the signatures in the original transaction
  and requires all signers to re-sign. This is especially problematic for
  multisig transactions or where signing is done on a dedicated hardware wallet
  or HSM.
- By definition, fee bumping increases the fee attached to a transaction. For
  CPFP especially, the new fee can be significantly higher. Accounting for that
  fee and who pays it (the user or the service provider) can be difficult.

These issues will be discussed in more detail in later sections of this
document.

## Considerations for high volume users

There are additional considerations for entities that make heavy use of the
Bitcoin blockchain, such as exchanges or custodians:

- Services have a certain number of UTXOs in their hot wallet. If all of those
  UTXOs are tied up in stuck transactions, and the service’s wallet doesn’t use
  unconfirmed UTXOs as inputs, then they can run out of UTXOs for new
  transactions.
- Using opt-in RBF allows services to ‘low ball’ their initial fee-rate. If the
  transaction fails to confirm in the desired time, the fee can be bumped. For
  entities sending a lot of transactions, the savings in fee can be significant.
- Using CPFP to bump the fee can increase the total fee significantly, since
  the total fee has to pay for both the child and parent transactions - whereas
  an RBF transaction is replaced entirely and so doesn’t need to provide fee to
  cover an extra transaction. For entities sending a lot of transactions, the
  additional fees can be significant.
- Services that are very frequent spenders and broadcast transactions to the
  blockchain every block can chain together spends and use CPFP without any
  additional overhead. If a transaction has not been confirmed by the time
  they need to broadcast their next transaction, they can use the change output
  from the first transaction in the second, and attach enough fee to bump the
  feerate across the entire package.
- Services that use
  [payment batching](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Techniques_to_reduce_transaction_fees#Payment_batching)
  effectively can bump many payments with a single RBF or CPFP.
- Services that are not using payment batching can use a large CPFP to bump
  multiple transactions at the same time, and potentially consolidate the UTXOs
  from those multiple transactions at the same time.
- The mempool code only allows transaction packages of up to 25 unconfirmed
  transactions (with a maximum weight of 404Kweight), so there’s a limit to the
  number of transactions that can be bumped with a single CPFP transaction.
- Services that have a coin selection algorithm that is effective at
  [change avoidance](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Techniques_to_reduce_transaction_fees#Change_avoidance)
  will have many transactions without change outputs, which can’t be bumped using
  CPFP. Larger wallets are able to avoid change more often since they have a
  larger set of UTXOs to choose from.

These issues will be discussed in more detail in later sections of this document.

# Transaction replacement

The concept of being able to 'replace' an unconfirmed transaction has been
around since the earliest days of Bitcoin. Early versions of the
Bitcoin reference implementation [allowed transactions to be replaced][full_replacement] by
constructing and broadcasting a replacement transaction with modified
`nSequence` numbers in the transaction inputs.

Satoshi understood the need for transaction fees to increase as the subsidy
decreased, saying in the [whitepaper][] 'Once a predetermined number of coins
have entered circulation, the incentive can transition entirely to transaction
fees and be completely inflation free.' He also understood that users would
need a way to be able to bump the fee on a transaction if it got stuck. There
was [a question on the bitcointalk forum][bct q] in 2010:

> Just wondering about the following example :
> I broadcast a transaction, sending X coins to some address.
> Doesn't get included in blocks for a while because I don't include a fee.
> 
> Do I have a way to cancel it and broadcast it again with a fee this time ?

Satoshi [replied][bct a]:

> There's a possible design for far in the future:
> 
> You intentionally write a double-spend.  You write it with the same inputs
> and outputs, but this time with a fee.  When your double-spend gets into a
> block, the first spend becomes invalid.  [...]
> 
> It's easier said than implemented.  There would be a fair amount of work[...]

There are two main areas of difficulty that Satoshi is talking about: wallet
design and UX, and node and miner policy.

The wallet design and UX questions (how should a wallet track and display
conflicting transactions? How should it present a user interface for bumping
fee?) can be resolved by individual wallets and applications.

The node and miner policy difficulties require some kind of shared
understanding of how other nodes and miners on the network will behave. There
are two major difficulties to consider:

1. **DoS** - how do we prevent malicious actors from consuming node resources
   by repeatedly broadcasting replacement transactions for zero cost?
2. **Incentive alignment** - how do we make sure that replacement transactions
   are incentive-compatible and miners want to mine them?

Satoshi's first version of transaction replacement failed on both of these
counts. The `nSequence` number could be incremented millions of times without
changing the fee, wasting bandwidth and compute resources on all nodes in the
network. The replacement logic also didn't require the replacement transaction
to increase the fee, and could replace an old transaction with a new
transaction even if the replacement had a lower fee. If a miner was running
this software, the replacement behaviour would be costing him money since he'd
be mining transactions with lower fees.

For those reasons, Satoshi [disabled transaction replacement][disable replacement]
in 2010. When asked later why he'd disabled that code, his response was:

> Just to reduce surface area.  It wouldn't help with increasing tx fee. A tx
> starts being valid at nLockTime.  It wouldn't work to have a tx that stops
> being valid at a certain time; once a tx ever becomes valid, it must stay
> valid permanently.

Replacing a transaction does not invalidate the old transaction, so unless
there is an incentive for the miner to use the new transaction, then just
replacing an old transaction with one that has higher `nSequence` numbers
is not incentive-compatible.

## Replace-by-Fee

Replace-by-fee is an effort to make transactions replaceable whilst avoiding
the problems of exposing nodes to DoS vulnerabilities and misaligned
incentives.  This is achieved by only allowing replacement if the replacement
transaction has a higher fee than the replaced transaction. This prevents DoS
attacks since every replacement transaction costs the attacker additional
money, and ensures incentive alignment since the replacement transaction is
financially advantageous to the miner.

There are several [variants of replace-by-fee][rbf variants]. Although Bitcoin
Core may implement *delayed RBF* at some point in the future (there is
currently an [open PR][delayed rbf pr], which has support from several
developers), currently almost all nodes on the network are thought to implement
*opt-in RBF* as defined in [BIP 125][].


## BIP 125

BIP 125 is a specification for opt-in RBF written by Peter
Todd in December 2015. It describes the conditions under which an unconfirmed
transaction in a node's mempool will be replaced. BIP 125 is referred to as
*opt-in* RBF since the node will only allow a transaction to be replaced if
the sender has explicitly signaled that he wants the transaction to be
replacable (or if the transaction is the descendant of an unconfirmed
transaction signaling replaceability).

> WARNING: transaction replacement policies are outside the domain of consensus.
> A transaction not being marked as replaceable offers no guarantees that it won't
> be double-spent. Other nodes on the network may have different replacement
> policies and miners are free to select whatever transactions they want in
> blocks.

The spender signals that a transaction is replaceable by setting the `nSequence`
number on any of its inputs to less than (0xffffffff - 1). A transaction is
replaceable if it fulfils [five conditions][]. The BIP documents those condtions,
but the implications of those conditions may not be immediately obvious. The next
section describes some of those implications.

[five conditions]: https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0125.mediawiki#implementation-details

### Implications of the conditions for BIP 125 RBF

> One or more transactions currently in the mempool (original transactions)
> will be replaced by a new transaction (replacement transaction) that spends
> one or more of the same inputs if,

- implication 1: RBF can be used to replace multiple transactions at the same
  time. That could either be because the replacement transaction is directly
  replacing two or more original tranasactions by spending their inputs, or
  because the original transaction that is being replaced has descendants in
  the mempool which will also need to be removed.
- implication 2: Additional inputs can be added to the replacement transaction.
  This is useful if a wallet needs to bump the fee on a transaction but there
  is no change output to subtract the additional fee from.
- implication 3: The replacement transaction does not need to include all of
  the inputs from the original transaction. This can be extremely dangerous
  since wallets can easily overspend this way. For example, if the original
  transaction uses inputs A and B, a replacement transaction is sent with
  inputs B and C, and then that replacement transaction is replaced with a
  new replacement transaction using inputs C and D, the first transaction
  could be rebroadcast by a third party at any point in the future, and both
  would be valid! Wallets are advised to include all inputs from the original
  transaction in the replacement transaction unless they have very reliable
  tracking to make sure that they don't double-spend themselves.
- implication 4: the `nSequence` of the inputs in the replacement transaction
  are not considered, so a replaceable transaction could be replaced by a
  non-replaceable transaction. If a wallet wants to be able to replace the
  replacement transaction in future, it must signal opt-in RBF on one of the
  inputs of the replacement transaction.

> 1. The original transactions signal replaceability explicitly or through
> inheritance as described in the above Summary section.

- implication 1: It is not sufficient to look at an individual transaction
  to determine whether it can be replaced under this policy. A transaction
  may be replaceable because one of its unconfirmed ancestors signals
  opt-in RBF.
- implication 2: A transaction's replaceability may change! If it is does
  not signal opt-in replaceability, but one of its ancestors does, then it
  is replaceable. If the ancestor then gets confirmed, the descendant
  transaction becomes non-replaceable.

> 2. The replacement transaction may only include an unconfirmed input if that
> input was included in one of the original transactions. (An unconfirmed
> input spends an output from a currently-unconfirmed transaction.)

Rationale: this is an anti-DoS measure to stop a spender creating a replacement
transaction which has a higher feerate than the original transaction, but
adds new ancestor dependencies so that the ancestor feerate for the transaction
is lower.

- implication 1: if a wallet runs out of confirmed transactions (ie all of its
  coins are tied up in unconfirmed transactions), then it can't use the output
  of some of those transactions as additional inputs to bump the fee on its other
  transactions.

> 3. The replacement transaction pays an absolute fee of at least the sum paid
> by the original transactions.

- implication 1: if outputs from the original transaction have been spent, then
  the replacement transaction must exceed both the *feerate* and *total fee* of
  the original transaction and its descendants. If the child transaction is large,
  or there are many descendant transactions, then the total fee required to
  replace the original transaction could be very large. This can make it
  uneconomical to replace the original transaction and so is known as
  *transaction pinning*.

> 4. The replacement transaction must also pay for its own bandwidth at or
> above the rate set by the node's minimum relay fee setting. For example,
> if the minimum relay fee is 1 satoshi/byte and the replacement transaction
> is 500 bytes total, then the replacement must pay a fee at least 500
> satoshis higher than the sum of the originals.

Rationale: this is an anti-DoS measure to prevent an adversary from repeatedly
sending replacement transactions with miniscule feebumps and making the peer
revalidate many versions of the same transaction.

- implication 1: for transactions at low feerates, the proportional change
  in feerate from bumping is large. A transaction with a feerate of
  1 sat/byte needs to *double* its fee to satisfy this rule. For very
  large transactions (eg large consolidations), then the amount of money
  spent on fees could be high.

  Although BIP 125 specifies that the transaction must increase the feerate
  by the *minimum relay fee*, Bitcoin Core actually has a separate parameter
  for the amount that the fee needs to be increased by, called the
  *incrementalrelayfee*. By default this is set to the same value as the
  *minimum relay fee* - 1 sat/byte.

> 5. The number of original transactions to be replaced and their descendant
> transactions which will be evicted from the mempool must not exceed a
> total of 100 transactions.

Rationale: this is an anti-DoS measure to prevent an adversary from sending
replacement transactions that cause their peer to walk through many
transactions in their mempool. This scan through the mempool needs to be done
before calculating whether the replacement transaction has enough fee to
replace the original transactions, so an adversary could cause the peer to walk
the mempool without causing transactions to be replaced, which would be a free
attack.

## User Experience Recommendations

Even wallets and services that do not themselves support creating opt-in RBF or
replacement transactions should present a clear and accurate experience to
their users when dealing with RBF transactions:

- wallets that receive transactions that have opt-in RBF signaled may
  display that the transaction is signaling opt-in RBF (with a tooltip
  or pop-up box giving additional information about RBF).
- wallets must not double account replaced transactions (ie count a debit
  or credit twice if it appears in a replaced and replacement transaction).
- wallets and block explorers should continue to show replaced transactions
  after they have been replaced (either grayed out or hidden), with a clear
  indiction that the transaction was replaced and is no longer valid.
- wallets and block explorers should include information about the previous
  transactions that a replacement transaction has replaced. For example, if
  transaction A2 replaces A1, the page for A2 should include the information
  that "this transaction replaced transaction A1".
- Links to transactions that have been replaced should remain live on block
  explorers. They may redirect to the transaction which replaced them.

# Child-Pays-For-Parent

Child Pays for Parent (CPFP) is a wallet feature where a user spends the output
of an unconfirmed (_parent_) transaction as an input to a new (_child_)
transaction. The wallet attaches enough fee to the child transaction to
increase the combined feerate across the parent and child transactions.

## How does CPFP work?

When constructing a new block, miners are incentivized to fill the 4vMB with
the set of transactions that maximize the transaction fees. If all unconfirmed
transactions were independant, this would be a very straightforward operation -
the miner would select the transaction with the highest feerate and add it to
the candidate block. She'd then take the transaction with the next highest
feerate and add it to the block. She'd continue to do this until the block was
full. This trivially maximizes her profit from the block (with a little
complication around the final few bytes of the block to ensure that she'd
maximally filled the block).

However, unconfirmed transactions _aren't_ independant. It is possible to have
chains of unconfirmed transactions by spending the output from a transaction
before it is included in a block. For example, if tx A has two outputs a1 and
a2, transaction B could use one of those outputs as an input before A has
been included in a block. In this case, if the miner wants to include
transaction B in the block, she must also include transaction A, since without
A, B is spending a non-existent output and is invalid.

If the miner considered transactions independently when constructing her block,
she may forego transactions with very high fees if they depended on
transactions with very low fees (or worse, she may construct an invalid block
with a transaction that depends on an unincluded transaction). To maximize her
profit, the miner should therefore consider transactions in _packages_ (sets of
transactions with dependencies on each other) when constructing a new block.

Wallets can take advantage of this rational behavior by miners to incentivize
them to include a stuck, low-fee transaction, by spending one of its outputs
and increasing the total feerate across the transaction package.

## History of CPFP

For users to be able to bump a transaction using CPFP, two elements are required:

- a wallet that will spend the output of a stuck unconfirmed transaction in
  order to bump the combined feerate.
- The expectation that miners will maximize their profit by considering
  packages of transactions.

Before 2012 blocks were rarely full and so there was no fee market. The
Bitcoin Core mining component was therefore not very optimized to maximize
transaction fees when selecting transactions for block inclusion. Transactions were
first ordered by *prority* (the sum of the (value X coin age) for each
transaction input, divided by the transaction size), with an [increasing
feerate required][pre 0.7 tx selection] as the block filled up. Bitcoin Core
[PR #1590][] changed the mining code to predominently sort transactions by
feerate, with some space reserved for transactions with a high priority score.
[Version 0.7.0][], released in September 2012 was therefore the first Bitcoin
Core release to primarily order transactions by feerate.

At around the same time, Luke-jr started maintaining [a patch][CPFP patch]
which took into account the transaction fee of children transaction when
sorting transactions for inclusion in a block. This patch was used by at least
some miners, but was never merged into Bitcoin Core due to a lack of testing
and benchmarking, and concerns that it could open a DoS vector against miners.

The Bitcoin Core mining code was updated [in 2016][CPFP PR] to better account
for packages of transactions. The mining code will consider packages of up to
25 transactions or 101vkB. This change was included in [V0.13][].

At the time or writing (November 2018), it is almost certain that a majority of
miners are running Bitcoin Core V0.13 or later, or a derivative thereof.
Wallets can therefore safely assume that descendant transaction fees will be taken
into account when miners construct blocks.

## CPFP case study

The Hodlers Bitcoin Exchange (HBE) has several hundred thousand customers and
services thousands of withdrawals per day. Since they need to send many withdrawal
payments in every block, they batch withdrawals into a single transaction every
ten minutes.

[//]: # (TODO: Include a link to batching chapter)

HBE likes to keep fees low for their customers, so they set their transaction
fee very economically - they prefer to pay just enough to get into a block, but
no more! Occasionally, this means that the batch withdrawal transaction is not
confirmed and gets stuck in the mempool. This leads to customers complaining
about slow or stuck transactions.

To improve the experience for their customers, HBE implemented CPFP to bump the
feerate on stuck batch withdrawal transactions. To do this, they use the change
output from one batch withdrawal as the first input into the next withdrawal,
and make sure to include enough fee on the second withdrawal to raise the
average feerate across the two transactions. If that still doesn't bring the
feerate up to a high enough level to be mined, they then use the change output
from the second batch withdrawal as the input to a third batch withdrawal, and
so on.

There were a number of aspects that HBE needed to consider when implementing
their CPFP system:

- they need to ensure that every batch withdrawal includes a change output that
  comes back to them. If there's no change output, then they can't construct a
  child transaction to bump the fee of the parent transaction.
- they needed to do careful testing around the fee rate logic. The child
  transaction must pay for the parent transaction, so their algorithm needed to
  take the weight of the parent transaction and the fee that had already been
  paid into consideration when calculating the average fee rate. They needed to
  do the same process when creating a 3rd or 4th generation transaction to pay
  for its ancestors.
- the Bitcoin Core mining algorithm will only consider packages of up to 25
  transactions or 101vkB. HBE therefore needs to make sure they're not creating
  chains of transactions larger than that.

Overall, HBE is very happy with their new CPFP implementation. Support tickets
are down, and customers are usually unaware that that their withdrawals are
being fee bumped using CPFP, since the transaction id and output index of their
withdrawal does not change.

## User Experience Recommendations

Wallets and explorers should present relevant information about transaction
packages to users:

- if an unconfirmed transaction is part of a package of unconfirmed
  transactions, the service should allow an expert user to view ancestor and
  descendant feerate of the transaction alongside its feerate, to allow the
  user to more accurately predict the package's chance of inclusion in future
  blocks.
- block explorers may display transactions as *malleable* if any of their
  inputs are non-segwit. Malleable transactions may not be safe to include in
  chains of unconfirmed transactions, since malleating the signature invalidates
  any descendant transactions.

# Conclusion

Both Replace-By-Fee and Child-Pays-For-Parent are useful techniques for bumping
the fee on a stuck unconfirmed transaction. Each comes with its own benefits
and drawbacks, and depending on the situation it may be appropriate to use one
or the other (or both together).

Bitcoin engineers should be familiar with both techniques, and Bitcoin products
and services should present a clear and accurate experience to users when those
techniques are being used, even if they do not support creating RBF or CPFP
transactions.

# Footnotes

## Consensus, policy and incentive compatibility

Both solutions discussed in this article are related to network node and miner
behavior before a transaction is included in a block. That behavior is
therefore a question of policy rather than consensus. Both solutions are also
miner incentive-compatible - a miner who is trying to maximize his revenue will
accept both RBF’ed transactions and CPFP packages. Individual nodes’ mempools
(which should be a node’s best guess for what will be included in the next
blocks) should therefore also accept RBF’ed transactions and CPFP packages.
